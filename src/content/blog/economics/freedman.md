Let’s assume that you and I live in a small suburban town. It’s a small community of people. And I - a single human being - happen to be a seller. A lot of people in my community are in small businesses. A few of my friends are in the clothes business. And some others sell shoes and laces. I sell rice. What we sell isn’t important here. What really matters is that we’re the ones that keep the community together and the cycle moving. Why are we doing this? It’s an act of service to the community I belong to and to make a living out of it. So here I have two motivating factors a) Service to the community and b) we make some profit out of it and that profit inspires us to serve even more. What motivates us is vital. If I choose to raise the prices to make more profit then I’m checking just one box and it isn’t “Service to the community”. I can’t just raise the prices even if I’m the only one selling the stuff. It’s not ethical. It’s greedy and promotes self-interest.

In six months I hire a bunch of guys to help me with the business and I pay them weekly. OK, so, now I don’t have to raise the prices to make more profit. I can just cut their salaries. The community won’t have to pay high bucks for it. But my guys have families too. They’re part of the community. They too have life. I can’t just, in a sane mind, put them in that position just to make more money which doesn’t have any meaning attached to it. One might say, well if you need to grow your business you’re gonna need a lot of money. Yeah. And that’s why making a profit is important, we want to grow to serve the community. Still, the question is there, do you get to lower their salaries even a little bit? in the only case to just grow your business?

OK, we did cut the cost. We’re growing and shining and that’s attracting investors. At this point, I’m partnering with other business owners to develop together. Six men invested in my business and they did this for some reason. To get some divided out of their investing. They have a fair share in making decisions about how the company operates. Wait, did I just say “company”? Great. Baby, you’re a rich man. Investors want to make money and I have to make sure of that. I have the same product, the same market, and the same consumer. What do I do? Cut the cost? incentivize my people? I gotta hit the numbers every quarter. How do I make sure of that? Bonusing the guys who do their jobs (however unethical they are in their approach), and publicly shame the guys who didn’t work as bad as I wanted them? Like that [better.com](https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/6667213211723605682/7396266281334342650?hl=en#) CEO? I have to make profits to keep the investors happy or else they’re gonna leave and I’m doomed. How about we shut down the teams that didn’t bring much profit in the last quarter? PR’s gonna get a little messy after a mass layoff but who gives a fuck?

I was just an ordinary guy serving the community. Came in the guys I hired and we worked together, we cared for each other. Business was just a word used to refer to us and what we do. Here I am in a complicated situation. What do I do? Create an artificial crisis? Sell at whatever prices I want? Do I get to raise the prices *whenever* I want? Investors are busting your ass. What would you do? Fire the least productive guys? Is shaming them publicly gonna improve their performance? What happened to the idea of serving the community? You’re not even considering that idea anymore. Do you get to cross the confines of ethical boundaries? To a man, the answer is, Yes. The man is none other than the Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman.

In 1970, he published a piece that altered the way many people think about corporations, how they do business and their role in society. Friedman, in that famous essay, *The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits* railed against any corporate attempt to promote *desirable social ends* which he argued were *highly subversive* to the capitalist system. The simple message of the innocent article was: “there is one and only one social responsibility of business – to use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits…” That’s it.

Even Adam Smith, the legendary eighteenth-century Scottish philosopher, widely accepted as the father of economics wrote in *The Wealth of Nations*, “is the sole end and purpose of all production and the interest of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer.” He went on to call this idea, “perfectly self-evident.”

According to Friedman, you can’t do both because if you promote social advancement then that would eliminate your chances of making a profit and if you want to make a large-scale profit, you can’t possibly think of promoting any larger-than-life cause. Simple trade-off. Now I don’t want to get into the economic jargon but the trade-off is a central feature of an economist’s worldview. An economist falls apart and turns into a blubbing puddle on the floor if you take away the concept of trade-offs because they all started in the same place: the societal trade-off between guns and butter.

Friedman does add a parenthetical, “so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud,” we’ll get to that but for now it’s clear that his emphasis is on the first part. In layman’s terms, businesses should show no corporate responsibility, do nothing to further the goals of an ethical society, and do nothing to improve the lives of customers, employees or bystanders—*unless* these actions coincidentally maximize profits.

Smith did accept that it was human nature to act to advance their own interests. And that’s what he called the “invisible hand” and believed it ultimately benefits the consumer. “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we can expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest,” he explained. Fair enough, sir. But it works only when the system is in balance. You didn’t take into account that an entire group of self-interested outsiders would exert massive pressure on the baker to cut costs and use cheaper ingredients to maximize the investors’ gains. It’s the 21st century and the selfishness of outside investors, wearing the badge of *shareholder primacy theory* and the analyst community put the system completely out of balance.

Suppose 80% of the CEO’s pay is based on what the share price is going to do next year. In that case, he is going to do his best to make sure that the share price goes up, even if the consequences might be harmful to employees, customers, society, the environment or even to the corporation itself in the long term.

When we tie pay packages directly to stock price, it promotes practices like closing factories, keeping wages down, implementing extreme cost-cutting and conducting annual rounds of layoffs—tactics that might boost the stock price in the near term, but often do damage to an organization’s ability to survive and thrive in the long term. The time it takes before a company is forced out of the game is getting shorter and shorter. The average life of a company in the 1950s was over 60 years. Today it is less than 20 years.

Remember Freidman’s only guidance for the responsibility, we must act within the bounds of the law and “ethical custom”? Wait a second, what’s an “ethical custom”? Why not just say “ethics”? Does ethical custom mean that if we do something frequently enough it becomes normalized and is thus no longer unethical? I’m not gonna touch on the ideas like “If everyone is doing it, it must be okay”, or “This is how it’s been done for ages”, not today. But what about technology companies, like Facebook, and Google who rips off the social fabric for profit every second? What did they not do to maximize profit? Selling your data to third-party advertisers, and intelligence agencies and not to mention spying 24/7. Google, for one, replaced their motto “Don’t be evil” with “Do the right thing.” Can you spot the difference?

The buybacks are a legitimate practice that has been abused by public company executives seeking to prop up their share price. By buying back its own shares, based on the laws of supply and demand, they temporarily increase demand for its stock, which temporarily drives up the price (which temporarily makes the executives look good).

The form of capitalism that we have now is *not* the capitalism that Adam Smith envisioned. Milton Friedman theorized that the responsibility of business is to maximize profit within the bounds of the law. Clearly, Milton fucking Friedman never ran a business, because if all you focus on is money, your business will break. There’s only one thing that’s obsessed with growth for growth’s sake and that is cancer.

What we have here is a total abuse of capitalism. It is a bastardized capitalism that is organized to advance the interests of a few people who abuse the system for personal gain, which has done little to advance the true benefits of capitalism as a philosophy. Capitalism is about more than financial benefits. It’s about the progress we make in the quality of our lives, it’s about technological advancements and the ability of the human race to live and work together in peace and harmony.

To Friedman, a business has a single responsibility - profit. We need to replace Friedman’s definition with one that goes beyond profit and considers the dynamism and additional facets that make a business work. The definition of the responsibility of business must include: Advancing a purpose like Steve Jobs. He offered people a sense of belonging and a feeling that their lives and their work have value beyond their physical work. Protecting our people and consumers. Operating our companies in a way that protects the people who work for us, the people who buy from us and the environments in which we live and work. And finally, generate profit. Money is fuel for a business to remain viable so that it may continue to advance the first two priorities.

When you play the short-term game for too long, there are a few consistent and predictable outcomes: the decline of trust, cooperation, innovation and team spirit. And now we wonder why the millennials are not loyal.

You might call me naïve or anticapitalist. If you defend Friedman’s views on business, and many of the current and accepted business practices he inspired, then you’re probably one of those who benefit most from them. But that’s extremely unlikely from the 10 to 12 people who are gonna read this article. So if you’re just a regular consumer then listen, business was never just about making money. Even Henry Ford said, “A business that makes nothing but money is a poor kind of business.” Companies exist to advance something—technology, quality of life or anything else with the potential to ease or enhance our lives in some way, shape or form. This is the point I’m trying to make. And that’s not anticapitalistic. I’m a die-hard capitalist.

This idea is the central tenet of how we do business today. How did this dangerous idea stick for so long? People love mechanical simplicity, especially when it benefits them. In case you haven’t noticed, this idea totally diminishes responsibility. Who does that? An overgrown teenager? There’s no need to worry about nuance, no need to lose sleep over choices, and no endless laundry list of social ills to worry about. Just make more profit. Who is to blame? Smith? No. He put customers first. Friedman? No. We need to blame ourselves for letting selfish corporate officers get away with this reasoning and for rewarding people who have long ago stopped acting like people.

A business is a construct, an association of human beings combining capital and labour to make something. That business has precisely the same social responsibilities as the people that it consists of. The responsibility of a business is to use its will and resources to advance a cause greater than itself, protect the people and places in which it operates, create value for all those it engages with and generate more resources so that it can continue doing all those things for as long as possible. An organization can do whatever it likes to build its business so long as it is ~~within the bounds of law~~ responsible for the consequences of its actions.

There’s no such thing as a perfectly long-term leader or organization because we’re human beings. Stuff is messy. Things like fear, pressure, and incentive structures get in the way. But it’s a worthy pursuit. Because corporations are the ones that keep the world together.

Around two thousand years ago Aristotle argued that happiness does not derive from its pursuit but rather is the inevitable consequence of leading a virtuous life. The same applies to corporations. If they make it their purpose to maximize shareholder value, shareholders are likely to suffer because that cravenness turns off customers, employees, and the world in general. If they make it their purpose to serve customers brilliantly, be a fabulous place to work, and contribute meaningfully to the communities in which they operate, chances are their shareholders will be very happy.
