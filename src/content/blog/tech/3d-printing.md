Let’s crank up the time machine and take a trip some 3 million years into our past. Among others of our *Homo Sapiens* ancestors are roaming across what is now Southern Ethiopia a rare breed of craftsman. And one of our craftsman picked up a pair of rocks. Used one to chip away at the other. Until all that remained of the second was a sharp stone flake. Eureka!

Stone chipping, from the evolutionary perspective, was the birth of tool usage. It’s what enabled *Homo Sapiens* to stand above the rest of the species. And that was also the birth of *subtractive manufacturing*, a process of object creation wherein a larger block of material (a big flat stone) is subtracted from until all that remains is a large pile of debris and the desired object (the sharpened flake). For millions of years that’s how object creation essentially got done. Until now. Because now we have new form of technology that is emerging from a thirty-year period of deceptive growth and beginning to disrupt a portion of the $10 trillion global manufacturing industry. Whoa! Information overload to our craftsman friend. 

In the early 80s Chuck Hull took a look at the million years of mutation and changed this game. At that time Detroit’s ailing car industry was taking blows quarter after quarter for their way too long production line. To regain their competitive advantage, Hull decided to compress their time of manufacturing. He learned the curing (hardening) UV coatings methodology and realized that curing’s methodology opened the door for an entirely new manufacturing process.

Instead of having to create new plastic parts and prototypes through subtractive methods, if he could figure out how to print sheets of UV-hardened plastic atop one another (and attach them to one another), he could build new automotive components via accretion—a method of additive manufacturing in which objects are built up one layer at a time. This was the birth of 3-D printing. 

Think of your regular ink-jet printers. These ubiquitous office products are 2-D printers. They convert digital instructions from your device into an “object” (aka printed text on a page) by printing along a two-dimensional (x and y) axis. A 3-D printer does the same except it adds in another dimension. Vertical dimension (the z axis)—thus allowing for creation in all three dimensions. Hull constructed his first 3-D printer in 1984. The same year Apple computers launched their famous 1984 commercial campaign. Over the next 20 years Hull and his company 3D Systems conducted numerous development research and yet in the early 2000s, the company was on the verge of bankruptcy. At that time, technology was growing exponentially and Hull didn’t notice that trend. But someone did. Meet our new friend Avi Reichental. 

“Sure,” he says before buying the company, “3D Systems was on the verge of extinction but I applied Moore’s law to all the different verticals that went into this technology and saw they were all about to explode.” 

“What I realized was that 3-D printing is a ubiquitous connection between the virtual and the actual; it’s a technology with the potential to touch everything in our lives.” And boy was he right. 

When you create additively, complexity comes free of charge. This means you’re not constrained by any of the traditional manufacturing limits. You go straight from a computer file to a finished product, and can make millions of one-of-a-kind items without retooling or restocking. It’s localized manufacturing at every scale. 

When Reichental took the job, 3D Systems didn’t have much of a product suite. They made six different kinds of printers that could print in only four materials. Worse, 3D Systems didn’t manufacture any of those materials, and only certain materials worked with certain machines. Fun fact, their most powerful device was powered by two *print engines*. 

These days, 3D Systems is a thriving $6 billion company making over forty different printers—the largest one capable of printing a Toyota Camry dashboard as a single piece. These machines can print in over a hundred different materials, ranging from nylons, plastics, and rubbers all the way through biological materials (cells), real waxes, and even fully dense metals.

On a larger scale, 3-D printing is making its presence felt in the transportation industry. Today most cars coming out of America, Europe, and Japan include 3-D printed parts. In September 2014, at the International Manufacturing Technology Show in Chicago, Local Motors CEO Jay Rogers and his team 3-D printed an entire car on site in one day. Rogers describes digital manufacturing as the third industrial revolution. “The first revolution was the steam engine. Henry Ford gave us the second revolution, mass production, in which you can make something cheap as long as you make a million of them. The third revolution comes from the democratization of manufacturing, wherein a new car design does not require a new plant to be built.”

Because 3-D printing allows products to be perfectly matched to an individual’s body shape, 3-D printers are being used today to make individually customized surgical tools, bone implants, prosthetic limbs, and orthodontic devices

Example of large-scale medically related 3-D printing can be found in the fully automated factories of Align Technology, the makers of Invisalign—the clear plastic teeth-straightening alternative to metal braces. This factory 3-D prints 65,000 distinct aligners every day. “Last year alone,” says Reichental in 2011, “they printed seventeen million pairs of fully customized one-offs in a factory of the future not much bigger than a large college lecture hall.”

Every aspect of the $10 trillion manufacturing sector has the potential to be transformed. That’s $10 trillion worth of opportunity. And that’s not all. Let’s go supersonic into the space. 

SpaceX  3-D prints much of the rocket engine used in the Dragon 2 capsule, Boeing currently 3-D prints over two hundred parts for ten different aircraft platforms, and Planetary Resources is 3-D printing much of the spacecraft that will travel to and prospect near-Earth asteroids. 

Aaron Kemmer, Michael Chen, and Jason Dunn, three entrepreneurs got together to find the next innovative idea to transform the space frontier. “We wanted to start a company that would help open the space frontier. We were definitely not thinking the way forward was going to be 3-D printing”, says Kemmer. They didn’t know much about 3-D printing. Only Jason had a little history or poking around the 3-D printers in college. When they met Dan Barry, a three-time shuttle astronaut, they did a little analysis at all the different exponential technologies. Dan Barry kept wandering over and telling them he had been to the International Space Station (ISS), “Having a 3-D printer on the ISS would sure be useful”, said Barry. 

It was a supply-chain minefield. “The ISS is at the back end of the longest, most complicated, and most expensive supply chain in existence. Launch costs are roughly ten thousand dollars a pound. And any object sent into space has to be durable enough to survive the eight minutes of high g-forces it takes to get out of the Earth’s gravity well—which means building heavier objects. But any additional weight imposes a double penalty: Not only does every extra pound cost extra money, but it requires extra fuel to get off the planet, which means even more money”, says Dunn. Plus, when parts aboard the station break, resupply can take months and months even if the bureaucratic failure isn’t in the picture.

This is why there are over a billion manifest parts (meaning they’ve been paid for but have not necessarily flown yet) aboard the ISS. And after doing more research, Kemmer, Dunn, and Chen realized that 30 percent of these parts were plastic—meaning they should be printable with already available, off-the-shelf 3-D printing technology. Eureka! (Again). This was the birth of *Made in Space*, our first off-the-world 3-D printing company.

Their first offering, launched to the ISS in the fall of 2014, is the simplest: a 3-D printer that prints plastic parts. “The first 3-D printers on the ISS will be able to build objects that could never be manufactured on Earth,” says Kemmer. “Imagine, for example, building a structure that couldn’t withstand its own weight.” This is mind boggling! 

Made in Space’s next iteration is an advanced materials and multiple materials 3-D printer. Meaning some time in the next five to ten years 80 percent of the parts in use on the ISS will be printable. And just behind this version is the real game changer: .. Wait for it… a 3-D printer capable of printing electronics. In Space? Yes!

CubeSats are the latest trend in satellite technology. These are tiny satellites weighing only a kilogram made in the shape of a ten-centimeter cube. They’re so simple to build that almost anyone can pull it off (free instructions that are available online was enough to make me high!). These sats themselves are cheap to make (Roughly around $8,000-$10,000). But launching them is the real expense. 

“Turns out,” says Dunn, “the ISS [is] a perfect platform for launching things into low-earth orbit. Already our printers can print the cube portion of a CubeSat, and we’ve also printed the electronics in our lab. It’s hard to say for sure, but around 2025, we should be able to print electronics aboard the ISS. This means we’ll be able to *email* hardware into space for free, rather than paying to have it launched there.”

What does this all mean? It means that while Made in Space started off disrupting a billion-dollar spare parts industry, the exponential growth curves that underpin their business model lead them directly toward first mover advantage in the multitrillion-dollar industry that will eventually be off world living.

When I first got into the world of design thinking what excited me the most is the idea of rapid prototyping. The idea is so powerful that it’s innate to the whole of design thinking philosophy. Building tools and people love and designing products that transform the way with interact with the world is one the core driving factors for me. And the tool that is enabling this exponential innovation process is Stereolithography. OK, 3-D printing.
