Hey there! Got a minute? I'll tell you a story.

There was once a wise courtier in ancient Persia who presented the king with a chessboard. Intrigued by the sheer mechanics of the game, the king offered him: "Tell me how I can thank you." The wise man that he was, requested that the king cover it with rice. Starting with one grain on the first square and doubling the amount for the next one. And double that amount on the next one and then double again for the next square and so on. Not so wise, right? How much rice is that? Bear with me.

The king guessed about a sack. His servants began the task—placing a grain on the first square, two grains of rice on the second square, and four grains of rice on the third—and by the time they got to square 64, he realized that he would need more rice than was growing on earth! (210 Billion tonnes)

Take it or leave it; I've got your attention. Ever heard of exponential growth? This story demonstrates just that. It's when something keeps growing at an ever-accelerating rate. With that in mind, the people at Singularity University came up with the term "exponential technology." Technologies that are not only improving rapidly but whose rate of improvement, itself, is increasing over time. And it's unfathomable just how much powerful it is.

It's not your fault if you choose the first option between getting a thousand bucks for the next 30 days vs. 1 cent on day one, 2 cents on day 2, 4 cents on day 3, and 8 on day 4... We can't trust our intuition when it comes to growth rates. Just like our courtier friend, Gordon Moore wasn't taken seriously. In the 60s, he predicted that the number of transistors on a microchip would double about every two years (exponential growth). It's known as Moore's Law. To the king, it might haven't felt like a big deal, but by now you know it's wild! Choosing the first option gets you 30 grand! Choosing the second option gets you more than 5 million dollars!

The exponential increase in transistors leads to the mythical power of microchips, electronics, and computers. But here's the coolest part: Moore's Law has held true for decades and shows no signs of slowing down. This means microchips and electronics, and as a consequence to that technology, overall, is still advancing at an exponential rate and has the potential to continue improving at an even faster pace. And as technology advances, it creates ripple effects on other industries, leading to even more progress and innovation.

## Kodak Mistook It & Went Bankrupt!

Back in 1975, Steven Sasson, an employee at Kodak, used charge-coupling devices (CCDs) to build the world's first digital camera. The first time ever you could take pictures without film and show them on an electronic screen. You wouldn't need paper cause there's no need to print them. The camera was roughly the size of a bulky toaster. Weighed in at 8.5 pounds, had 0.01 megapixels of resolution, and could take over thirty digital images. The photos were black-and-white, but it was revolutionary. It was Kodak, folks.

When Sasson presented it to the board, he was excited about answering questions on the technical aspect of this camera, but what they asked was when it was going to be ready for prime time. Kodak was known for their cameras, but they were mainly in the memory business. Storing images in films was their proprietary tech. How long would it take for digital photography to pose a threat to Kodak's film business? Sasson estimated 15–20 years, relying on Moore's Law. Where he went wrong is in estimating how far the executives could stretch their minds.

Linear growth is intuitive. But we have no sense of exponential growth. None. Why is this? We didn't need it before. I'm studying Materials Science & Engineering and spent quite some time studying how people built things from the stone age till the last century. People rarely, if ever, had to come across exponential growth. Most of their experiences were of *linear variety*. The wealthiest man in the world was happy because he owned twice the land the man lying in the next cave did. Whoever spent twice the time collecting berries earned double the amount. If you had two sons, you possessed more power than the guy with one.

The executives (like that king) were miserable in understanding how a low-resolution 0.01 megapixels digital camera could hop on an exponential growth curve and eventually provide high-resolution images. Totally nonsense to invest money in R&D. So, they did what any rational and sensible person would do after that judgment: bury the technology. In 1996, Kodak, a 100-year-old behemoth, had around 150,000 employees and a $28 billion market cap. In 2012, Kodak filed for bankruptcy. The same year, Facebook acquired Instagram for $1 billion. This story is mind-boggling if you don't know.

## F@&k you, Dinosaurs!

Before us, dinosaurs dominated every corner of the earth. It took only one giant asteroid to destroy the species and made it habitable for us. Exponential Technology is the new giant asteroid. And the dominating dinosaurs are the greedy big businesses still with the conviction, "that's how we've been doing things because it WORKS!". Don't give a fuck about innovation? Well, exponentials don't give a fuck about you either. You are the rich guys drinking Champaign on the top deck of Titanic, and Exponential is the fucking iceberg.

As I said, it's hard to trust our default intuitions, but we need the neural circuitry to understand how this sort of shift unfolds. The traits of the exponentials. And to explain that, Peter Diamandis developed the Six Ds of Exponentials. In his book BOLD, he makes the case that technological advancement is a domino effect. Which manifests in the form of Digitization, Deception, Disruption, Demonetization, Dematerialization, and Democratization. All these (all six of them) Ds put together will inevitably result in great upheaval and opportunity.

Here's a quick run-down of the six Ds.

1. Digitization: This is how we turn physical objects or information into digital products. Remember buying physical music and movie CDs in-store? Now you stream online or download them, and the very idea of a physical CD is unknown to most kids these days. Today, you have YouTube and Spotify. In Kodak's case, once the memory business went from a physical process to ones and zeros, its growth rate became entirely predictable: Digitization. It was now on an exponential curve.
2. Deception: At this stage, people don't really care because they don't understand the potential of the technology. Take personal computers. When PCs were first introduced, many people saw it as a toy for hobbyists and hackers. Imagine Kodak's first digital camera with 0.01 megapixels doubling to 0.02, 0.02 to 0.04, and 0.04 to 0.08. Once these doublings topped the whole-number barrier, i.e., became like 1.01 or 1.02 or higher, they are only 20 iterations away from a millionfold improvement.
3. Disruption: As the technology advances, it starts to shake up existing industries and business models. Disruption must follow Deception. Kodak discovered their mistake, but it was too late. They began experiencing financial blows in the 1990s and stopped generating revenues by 2007. Five years later, Kodak filed for Chapter 11 protection. Funny thing about Nuclear Energy is there is where it's stuck even after Bill Gates has been pushing to move the needle for a decade now.
4. Demonetization: How much did you pay for Gmail in your lifetime? ChatGPT is free! Sure, you watch ads on YouTube, but the seconds spent on ads is just a fraction of your daily watch time. Facebook? Free. Even most of the developer tools are open-source. This is demonetization. The cost of tech goes down as the technology improves.
5. Dematerialization: This is ridiculous. The digital camera itself got dematerialized when Steve Jobs introduced iPhones. Not only did it come free, but consumers also expected this with any other smartphones in the market. In Sasson's time, Kodak possessed 85% of the camera market. That market literally vanished in 2008. Only a year after the first iPhone with a high-quality digital camera.
6. Democratization: I call it "realizing Steve." Why? Steve was convinced that technology would level the playing field between the "big brothers" and Us. It could give individuals a voice in societies where they may otherwise have been marginalized. Kodak got stuck in their memory business norm. Instagram democratized photography. They got into the memory business but in a totally different form-factor. Creating memories in our everyday life. It's not hard to play *the infinite game* (shoutout to Simon Sinek) of life and develop technologies that actually make the world a better place. But if you know anything about business, tech is no different. To quote the Script, "It took away the prophet's dream for profit on the street."

## What Does It Have to Do with AI?

Well, stay tuned for the article next week. But for now, here's a little glimpse:

John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, two bright young mathematicians, kept trying to persuade the inventor of information theory, Claude Shannon, to join them in a quest. They had an idea: "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can … be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." Their goal was simple: To find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, and solve problems now reserved for humans. "We think a significant advancement can be made…" said McCarthy, "…if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer."

Just a summer! OK. Anyway, in 1956, they persuaded Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester, the guy who designed IBM's first PC. Their goal, essentially, was to digitize our decision-making and imagination process. That meant training a machine how to learn, think, and reason like we do, and build cases better than we do. And in the early days, it was pretty successful. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon developed the first AI program, the Logic Theorist. McCarthy developed the LISP programming language and went on the build a program that could solve problems in mathematical logic. Allan Robinson developed an algorithm for general-purpose logical reasoning. Joseph Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, which could understand and generate natural language. You can call it the grandfather of ChatGPT.

Yet, in the 1960s, after all these astonishing advancements, they failed to live up to the expectations of machine learning and translation. AI entered to dark ages: the Deception stage. Even people working on AlphaGo in 2014 said they were joked about for working on something that has "no future." Obvious! Who cares about 0.08 doubling to 0.16?
