John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky, two bright young mathematicians, kept trying to persuade the inventor of information theory, Claude Shannon, to join them in a quest. They had an idea: "Every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can ... be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it." Their goal was simple: To find how to make machines use language, form abstractions, and concepts, and solve problems now reserved for humans. "We think a significant advancement can be made…" said McCarthy, "…if a carefully selected group of scientists work on it together for a summer."

Just a summer! Anyway. In 1956, they persuaded Shannon and Nathaniel Rochester, the guy who designed IBM's first PC to join them at Dartmouth College. Their goal, essentially, was to digitize our decision-making and imagination process. That meant training a machine how to learn, think, and reason like we do, and build cases better than we do. And in the early days, it was pretty successful. Allen Newell and Herbert Simon developed the first AI program, the Logic Theorist. McCarthy developed the LISP programming language and went on the build a program that could solve problems in mathematical logic. Allan Robinson developed an algorithm for general-purpose logical reasoning. Joseph Weizenbaum developed ELIZA, which could understand and generate natural language. You can call it the grandfather of ChatGPT.

Yet, in the 1960s, after all these astonishing advancements, they failed to live up to the expectations of machine learning and translation. AI entered to dark ages: the Deception stage. Even people working on AlphaGo in 2014 said they were laughed at for working on something that has "no future." To everyone’s merit, they had a stack of undeniable evidence that AI is a bubble that burst twice. First in the 60s and then in the 80s.

And here we are in 2023, experiencing a gravity of disruption that has shaken humankind to its core. New AI breakthrough is on the front page of every news article and on YouTube. Soon, its capabilities will surpass all human domains. When will that happen? That’s a long-standing debate. Ray Kurzweil, one of the oracles in this field, predicts that AIs will be capable of outperforming humans in all areas by 2029. Kurzweil is notorious for his accurate predictions based on the exponential growth curve.

### Yourself in Extreme Pressure and Darkness.

These Disruptions are followed by the dark deception that AI entered in McCarthy’s era. Gaining the capability and momentum to disrupt the existing systems isn’t a picnic, be it AI or the internet (which too was ridiculed in the 90s, by the way). The universe will do whatever it takes to remain in homeostasis. The deception stage is the art of being unsexy at its finest. Sloths are faster than AI’s growth in the beginning. Gradually, the field became mathematically sophisticated and extremely complex in the dark ages. And allow me to dump a cheesy motivational quote, ”To form a diamond of yourself, you must put yourself in extreme pressure and darkness.”

The seeds of today’s hype around AI were sown in the dark age. We developed algorithms to tackle problems using control theory, probability and statistics and came up with probabilistic reasoning. The complete mathematics of deep convolutional networks were developed. Through trial and error, the concept of Trial & Error was invented: the idea of reinforcement learning. AI stayed in the deception for nearly as long as Captain America. But during that time, probabilistic reasoning mutated itself into what we call Deep Learning and that’s when machine learning finally began to gain the momentum it needed to disrupt the system.

In layman’s terms, what probabilistic reasoning does is figure out the best probability to win in a situation even if the total point is less than some other point in the vector space with a lower probability, and then search in that vector space to figure out the best move without simulating every possible move. It’s asking, “I’m still winning. Why bother risking that for more points?” This is hilariously right. A few months ago, I built a model to simulate a game. Basically, you’re standing at the starting point in a hallway and there are enemies standing at different locations around it. Get to the end of the hallway to collect the trophy. That’s the “Win” situation. If you kill an enemy fighter, you score points.

The first few runs were hilarious, it kept running into walls and shooting nowhere before getting killed. Later, after shooting in every direction and killing a few enemies, it realized how to score points. While it was training, the idiot I am, began daydreaming about how I could use it to modernize room-cleaning for the military. Then came my ‘Mind of the Machine’ moment.

The AI somehow figured out a way to bypass all the enemy shooting by running super fast before they reach it and it got the trophy. Wish I could show you the footage. The enemy doesn’t look back; he figured it out. If you just cross them, bingo! Now, why I’m telling you this? It reduced the total score by almost 800% compared to the highest it scored in all the iterations! It didn’t bother to lose 800% points to ‘Win’. It won and no one died.

### The Disruptions that Followed.

AI entered the disruption stage by flexing its muscles, or by firing up its neural network in public. In 2011, IBM’s Watson defeated the champions in the game Jeopardy. AI began to defeat professional poker players in no-limit games. But the straw that broke the camel’s back came in 2016 when DeepMind’s AlphaGo defeated Lee Sedol in the game of Go. At that time, he had 18 Go world championships under his belt. This was predicted to happen, if ever, around the year 2100!

That’s how ruthlessly machines learn to imitate. Researchers estimated it would take another hundred years for that to happen; DeepMind did it in three! Today we have Dall-E, which is better at *imagining* with its hyper-realistic artworks. Google’s Duplex books appointments that are indistinguishable from humans. And if you haven't been living under a rock for the past few months, you know how ChatGPT took the entire world by storm. AI is outperforming us in ways that are downright human.

The valley of Deception.

The interesting thing about future AI breakthroughs is that a lot of things are already invented but totally oblivious to the world outside of labs. Soon, they will cross the threshold and people will invest money and engineering effort to create commercial products. If those products make an impressive demonstration in public, then the media will announce a new breakthrough in AI and ask the bloody question, “Why did they keep it hidden for so long knowing that we needed it?”

Where no one is looking at for breakthroughs is where exactly it is happening. Saw the term Random Forrest or Personalized Medicine anywhere? You will, when it becomes cool and catchy as *Algorithm* or *Self-driving car*. We can sequence the entire human genome within a matter of hours. AI is being used to figure out the genetic markers that might be linked to certain diseases and formulate medicine tailored to our genetic profiles. Researchers at Duke University used AI to accurately predict the risk of heart disease among patients with diabetes. Some researchers achieved a 68.7% accuracy in predicting which patients are more likely to get readmitted to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. All by using an algorithm that was developed in 2001. This market is expected to hit $3.7 Trillion by 2027.

The stream of news we get every day has the same pattern, big tech is using AI for the limited amount of stuff we engage with every day. Chatbots are no small feat but it’s like comparing Navy SEALs with an average Call of Duty player. Finding a hundred shortcuts to tackle long and tedious math problems for a test doesn’t make you a good mathematician. Far from it. We don’t want machines to be intelligent to this extent. And that’s what I’m excited about: The disruptions that are yet to come.

YouTube or Facebook algorithm feeds stuff that is perfectly catered towards us and our individual preferences. But that’s today. “Soon”, Kurzweil says, ”we will give an AI permission to listen to every phone conversation you have. Permission to read your emails and blogs, eavesdrop on your meetings, review your genome scan, watch what you eat and how much you exercise, and tap into your Google Glass feed. And by doing all this, your personal AI will be able to provide you with information even before you know you need it.”

### If It Inspires You...

Moore's law says the number of transistors on a microchip would double about every two years. Today the market of deep learning has an annual growth rate of 42%. This means it doubles in size in about two years. Same old story.

AI might be the most dangerous thing we ever came up with but some say the internet is our greatest invention. I didn’t see the development of the internet. Heck, I was born around the time the dot com bubble burst.

A team of great minds came together in 1956 at Dartmouth for a summer. They were wrong, spectacularly wrong about their ability to crack AI but that was enough to set the direction for a kid's life seventy years later. If this inspires you, then pass it on to someone else.
