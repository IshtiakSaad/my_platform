Remember the scene in Avengers: Endgame when Captain America fights his past self on the 14th floor of Stark Tower? As a student of personality theory, it's one of the most fascinating things to me in the entire MCU. The concept of fighting one's past self and doing so in the most unexpected situation and creating unforeseeable mess-ups. This idea is nothing new in films. One prominent example is Christopher Nolan's 2006 film The Prestige, in which Hugh Jackman's character kills himself every night after the show. But that narrative follows an entirely different theme.

In Endgame, you might see it as just an attempt to add a little flair to the time travel BS, but it's way more than that. It's a constant battle between our past and present selves, our former beliefs, and our current understanding.

In my observation, our identity lags behind our experiences by two years (plus or minus six months). Meaning if you're Justin Beiber and became famous when you were a teenager, then by the time you hit your 20s, you'd realize that constantly being chased by media and gossip magazines all day isn't what you'd want. You had the same experiences as a teenager, but you didn't realize the consequences they would have on your identity. You surfed on them; meanwhile, they became a part of your identity, and now you hate yourself.

Now let's put Steve Rogers into two archetypes: Captain America Steve Rogers, a World War II super soldier. A righteous man who lost his best friend, went into a deep sleep for almost seventy years and woke up in a world where everyone he knew was gone. And then we have the Avenger Steve Rogers, who operates on a different battlefield than in 1942. The line between good and evil is so volatile and ambiguous that Captain America Steve Rogers failed to navigate it. A new lens was needed to observe the world, and that's the inception of Avenger Steve Rogers. Smarter and wiser than the World War II super soldier.

Now let's go back to the fight scene. 
Captain America Steve Rogers: I have eyes on Loki on the 14th. 
Avenger Steve Rogers: I'm not Loki. And I don't wanna hurt you.

Surely, the young Steve doesn't know that it isn't Loki, but it symbolizes that we're oblivious to our own future and how things will turn out. As for old Steve Rogers, he's worried about retrieving the stones. Even though he knew the younger self would be on the same floor on that exact walkway, he didn't notice it until he stood ten feet away from the younger self. How often has it happened that you're in the flow and knocking out everything that stands in the way when suddenly your past self decides to say "Hi" and kill the mojo? This is exactly that. Disgusting. "...I don't wanna hurt you." Why would he? The Avenger Steve is wiser and less rhetorical than his younger self. Wars aren't fought with guns. Diplomacy means deception. He fights alien species now. Holding on to past grudges isn't an option for him. The younger self hasn't faced the trials and tribulations of SHIELD and Thanos. Whatever he did in the past resulted from a narrow black-and-white understanding of reality. What's the point of dreading his past? Bucky was his biggest resentment. Older Steve knew this very well. But by then, Bucky had already returned to his life before vanishing away in Wakanda. Funny, he used the cheat code to disarm his past self, "Bucky. Is. Alive."

This story isn't about physical confrontation. It's about facing the demons that we all carry everywhere. This story is simply about our fundamental struggle to grow and evolve. You're not the same person you were six months ago, whether you realize it or not. We made mistakes and held on to beliefs that we now cringe about. That doesn't mean we're ashamed of our past. Now the question is, "How do I fight my past self?" And the answer is, You don't.

I remember a friend yelling before a test, "I feel like going back six months to meet myself and beat the shit out of that m*therfucker." When Avenger Steve Rogers said, "That is America's ass," he expressed something similar. "This idiot was the hero of America? Seriously? This asshole?". Gamora said something similar about Chris Pratt's character somewhere at the end. She was furious, just like that friend of mine. But Steve wasn't angry. No. This time it goes beyond past detachment and to the idea of *Amor Fati*: Love of Fate.

Nietzsche called this the formula for the ultimate human greatness. Not just accepting our past, not just forgiving, but embracing it. He said, "that one wants nothing to be different, not forward, not backward, not in all eternity. Not merely bear what is necessary, … but love it." This is the most hard-hitting discovery in my analysis. Near the end of the movie, present-day Steve Rogers becomes worthy of pulling Mjölnir. By embracing his fate, the good and evil, the pain and resentments, or the moments of joy, he achieved the personal greatness that the film portrays.

This idea of Amor Fati in and of itself is a form of meditation and saved me from so many nights of despair. I keep repeating myself, "Amor Fati. Amor Fati. Amor Fati." And things seem clearer. I'll write about it someday, I promise.

The way I see it, the theme of Endgame revolves around redemption. Mistakes were made in the past. You can't undo them. Everything became dark and gloomy because you can't accept them either. And the moment they were given the salvation window, they were ready to do "whatever it takes."

Reflect on who you are and what you've been through. Ask yourself, "Why did I believe that way? Why did I behave that way? What were the preconditions?" Trust me, you'll always find some discrepancies to fix up. Use your current knowledge to create a more accurate picture of reality. Steve Rogers does this many times throughout the MCU timeline. Identifying patterns in my thinking and behavior is one of the most difficult yet worthy pursuits I've ever undertaken, and it's a lifelong journey. Steve Rogers was a WWII super soldier, yet he turned out to be dumber than his future self. This goes on to show you that no matter what goals we attain or what we become, we're always a lot dumber than we think we are.
