Mimicking what the others are doing. As children, we learned at an unimaginably fast pace. That didn't happen because of carefully scrutinizing every move we're gonna make. It also didn't happen because we lacked the knowledge. And it definitely didn't happen because we considered others' opinions about it.

We just did it.
Fell down.
Got back up and up again.
That's how I learned to walk, ask questions, form relationships, and the most complex skills one can master in life. And as I got older, that's how I learned to swim, ride a bicycle, or play cricket. And it became muscle memory.

It happened because we were comfortable being clueless. We were comfortable asking what we didn't know; we wanted to do things we'd never done before. That's curiosity.

What I believe is that curiosity doesn't diminish altogether. It only gets suppressed by an asshole. And that asshole takes up different camouflage: Social validation, Fear, Public persona, what-would-other-people-think shit, herd mentality,…boy, you name it.

That thing had a downside too. You don't know if you should touch a hot stove? Fine. Go touch it. Congratulations, you'll never do that again. Ammu told me not to have ice-creams at school? OK. But ammu isn't here, and ice cream tastes great, and I wouldn't mind having a bite. And there you go, sick for seven days.

The bottom line is, as grownups (don't feel sorry, adults), we have a choice. To act out of our values or to act out of our emotions. That urge to mimic is still there, and once you remove that asshole sitting in the prefrontal cortex of the damn brain, it becomes a habit again. The question is, is it harmful? Is it against my values and principles? No? Then, Go like hell. If Yes, then channel that mimicking monkey to something that isn't. And here it is... one of the most incredible things you learn in life.
