If you haven’t seen thumbnails on YouTube titled “Six Habits that are keeping you poor”, “7 habits that made me a Multi-millionaire by the age of 22”, “8 Traits of people who made it”, “five books that made me a multi-millionaire by 27”… then you’re living a quite peaceful life I must say. In the race of getting rich and beating the system millions of people like you and I plug into those videos, curated by narcissistic puppet masters that only fuel in the dirt. Selling advice like reading 5 books gonna make you a millionaire. You read those books then what? Well, go watch the next video. What those videos don’t tell you or can’t tell you is that success or in my view, market acceptance in any domain requires a transaction of value between multiple parties and you gotta be one of those parties, providing that value in some shape or form.

I am an avid reader. So much so that it got me into trouble while reading during a lecture session. And after reading around 200 pieces of nonfiction, I’m still broke. I’m not against reading books and as a matter of fact, I tell everyone to get it drilled into their daily life to read at least a book per month. It’s gonna rewire your mindset and how you perceive the world. Ok, enough of hyping my own shit. Sorry, just a little more. When I was in high school, I got more things done than this well-organized, read-a-lot-idiot version of myself. I’ve wondered, “How?”. Then, something grabbed me by the shoulder and slapped a hard-ass truth on my face. That high-school-monkey was way more disagreeable than I am. Holy shit. That monkey didn’t bother to show his crappy work and those bad works opened the door for new and new opportunities.

What’s “disagreeable”? It’s basically saying that you’re more stubborn and argumentative than most people. On the flip side, agreeable people tend to avoid conflict and always look for easy-going calm water. And this phenomenon is so vital to understanding human nature that it takes up an entire dimension in the Big Five personality model. The big five, or OCEAN as the acronym goes, is academically validated and most accurate in describing your personality which describes your Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Boy, do I love jargon. Those 5 traits are fluid and one might work against the others in a particular situation. Being conscientious keeps neuroticism in check. Disagreeableness might lead to better execution of a task. Being agreeable will, perhaps, make you an open person.

Now, don’t get me wrong, being disagreeable doesn’t mean it’s bad or he looks for conflict. Conflict, in this context, doesn’t mean Israel-Palestine ‘conflict’ (Dark Humor). It means, standing up for your opposing view or having the courage the push back against social nonsense and being stubborn enough to go Head ON towards the things that you’re passionate about no matter how many times your parents prisoned you not to. That’s why that monkey got more things done. He would sneak outta the house with a bunch of other monkeys to do something or storm out into the road with his cycle, knowing a WrestleMania is waiting when he gets back. I’d became way too institutionalized to pull those maneuvers and spend quite some time to make a revival. These days I can traverse the agreeableness scale depending on the situation. This leads to the big point: Having a contrarian view if you wanna establish a stronghold for yourself in the game of life.

We all make this transition in life of getting institutionalized. That institution could be your family, school, workplace, or society in general, which, to some degree is necessary. But there’s a high probability that your meaning in life lies in actualizing the inner child. I’m a big believer in having a strong enough ‘Why’ to life and damn sure it breeds from our childhood upbringing. And to do that, sir, you really really really need to have a certain level of disagreeableness in your personality. Most people won’t get your ‘Why’ and in extreme cases, you might even be criticized if not ridiculed. In the age of giant-sized computers, Steve Jobs believed in PCs. Ray Dalio became Ray Dalio because he foresaw the 2008 financial crisis and prepared for it. Munir Hasan was stubborn enough to believe that our nation has the potential to bag a gold medal in International Math Olympiad and in 2018, we did that. Having a contrarian view and having enough disagreeable juice to move forward is a must for self-actualization.

The measure of productivity, these days, is how productive you are at making productivity videos on YouTube. I often joke with friends about it. But seriously, making videos with fancy music that has nothing to do with the context, blabbering the same-old shit for 24 minutes using 7 steps, and a Fiverr video editor to add a few cuts here and there will get you enough sponsors and ad revenue to make it look like you’ve made it. Creating a step-by-step process for everything is the first step toward the true hell of deep dissatisfaction. Especially as a beginner.

First, I don’t know if those guys really made it. You can hire a photographer and rent a Lambo or even a small-sized chassis of an abandoned private jet with a finely decorated interior and polished leather seat for a couple hundred bucks for 90 minutes and that proves your point: You’ve made it. This leads to the second question. What does “really made it” mean anyway?

Demographic data says the people who consume those videos are mostly 18-26 year-old males. Differences among these wannabees in their goals are so innocuous that putting them in hard-lines won’t be a mistake but a wise move. Get a $2M supercar, a mansion by the reef, another supercar, $10 million in the bank account, and lots of crypto investments, and retire by 26. None of those things are inherently bad, but when taken arbitrarily, will cause you big trouble.

If you’re Max Verstappen, running for RedBull in F1 track then what car you drive matters. If you’re managing a $100 million portfolio then $10 million of cash equivalent is excellent. If you can navigate the harsh terrain of crypto then wonderful, because crypto ain’t going anywhere. The point is, each move or each goal of yours has to be tied to an infinite context, or else none of those things will ever lead to happiness. As Jim Carrey once said, “I think everybody should get rich and famous and do everything they ever dreamed of so they can see that it’s not the answer.”

A millionaire by 25 means either of three cases a) you’ve inherited it. b) you’re a self-made millionaire or c) you’re lying. If you’ve inherited it, then the tragic backstory that you’re selling isn’t true. If you’re a self-made millionaire then you’re probably sunk deep into critical business decisions and don’t have time to make “money” videos twice a week. And in the final case, you’re lying. Human brain is naturally sensitive toward negative events and red is a common color in those video thumbnails. Professionally sculpting the right headline that evokes a false sense of scarcity is a cakewalk in the age of AI.

Now, what does work in the game of life? That’s a big discussion. Rather than fixating on some arbitrary goal, the first half of your 20s should be spent exploring and exploiting different dimensions. Network with as many people as possible but have this question as your radar, “Do I wanna hang out around these folks if/when I’m not a [insert a hustle]”. Good connections made in this defining decade will form lifelong relationships as they say. Attention to detail, bro. There’s no shortcut, sure, but the path to mastery isn’t that long. Mastering the basics will get you ahead of 95% of the people because it’s rare. Most people don’t do the basics right.

Don’t be an asshole. Have meaningful discussions apart from work, share your views, and rather than waiting for your turn to speak, listen to their stories. Find people to share your dreams and visions with. Form real friendships. None of those things will bring you $10 million by 27, but it will take you on the path of a meaningful life and you’re the one who will stand the test of time. This is what matters the most, is what you’re doing actually meaningful and will you stand the test of time. Now, why is this generation so obsessed with getting those kinda stuff? Unresolved traumas in the past.

Gen Z can’t socialize like previous generations. And we now have empirical evidence that trauma is correlated to social anxiety although not the direct causation. Trauma could be any autopilot interpretation of a painful event or memories of being abused or neglected or ignored. Rather than resolving those deep-rooted issues, we shaped our life around those traumas which led to the belief that getting ultra-successful will somehow heal those wounds or at least compensate for them. “The effects of early stress or adverse experiences directly shape both the psychology and the neurobiology of addiction in the brain.” as Gabor Mate writes in In the Realm of Hungry Ghosts. “We create meanings from our unconscious interpretation of early events, and then we forge our present experiences from the meaning we’ve created. Unwittingly, we write the story of our future from narratives based on the past…” When our fathers’ generation joined the workforce, they had to make this transition too. But they knew, from their upbringing and surroundings, how to cope with the struggle and load that’s demanded of a fresh kid in the game. We don’t.

I don’t blame the 1.2M people who watch a video and not all of them are stuck in tutorial hell. What I’m scared of is that there are millions of people in my age group who don’t have someone to talk to, who don’t have a friend to call and say, “Hey, I just wanna cry”, who don’t have meaningful social interaction. If you think about the future we’re headed toward then it’s a bleak picture but worth considering. Because most of those people won’t “really make it” and that will lead to more trauma. What are we gonna do about that?
