They say, when boats were made of wood, men were made of steel. Actually, it’s a book by Charles Draper. What he was referring to was the warrior ethos embodied by men across all civilizations for centuries. They were poets, teachers, farmers, distant runners, boxers, hunters, and philosophers (not the arm-chair-college-professors, mind you), and artists. Above all, they were protectors, warriors. Protected their homeland, protected their mothers and sisters and wives and children. They protected each other on the battlefield and off the battlefield.

I always honored that kind of species that walked on earth long before me. What motivates someone that they will lay down their own lives for their brothers? It never occurred to them what would their families do, how would they live without him taking care of them? What creates that bond?

And those who lived because of their brothers’ ultimate sacrifice, how did they spend their lives? There’s this thing called “survivor's guilt” among warriors. “God, why would Theo die and not me?” They would think to themselves. Because warriors were there to protect, and seeing a brother fall is the biggest failure ever. This guilt became a drive for those protectors. A drive to live a life that would honor the fallen. Because there was one thing more shameful to them than anything else in the world: Disgrace in the eyes of their brothers. Code above all else. On and off the battlefield.

That meant, at the end of the tunnel when you stand before the person who gave up every single one of their tomorrows, every moment of joy with their wife and kids so that you could live every one of your todays, you have to stand there and explain to this person how you lived your life, how you behaved, the actions that you took, how did you honor their sacrifice or did you honor it at all or did you use it as an excuse to auger in. This is how they lived their lives.

For so long I thought, why would I have to answer for my actions and attitudes and behavior to someone else? It’s my life. And then I realized what I shared with you. And only human beings on earth you must answer to are the people who made sacrifices for you. They can and should and will judge you. Swallow it. But you and I didn’t see war, never lived that reality. So I think we get a pass, no?

What about our parents, then? Did they never make any sacrifice for you? Their entire lives are devoted to you and your future. Once you popped into the earth, their entire life started revolving around your well-being. So, is it too much to ask to explain our actions and behavior to them? I could go on forever in that tunnel, you know what I mean. Ammu devoted every day to her family and Abbu still showed up to his job no matter how harsh it was, because he must make a living for his kids. And we grew up to watch memes all day and yell at their faces.
