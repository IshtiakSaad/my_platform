The question that’s rattling my brain upon arriving here in RUET is, “Why’s nobody talking about the admission test?” I mean, it’s one of the toughest - if not *the* toughest - challenge we’ve been through so far. We all have been through that *war*, “How come everybody forgot that? or is it just me being delusional about my hustle stories?” 

Well, it’s been 9 weeks here and now I know the answer. Dude! I don’t know where to begin. I feel like there’s a reason why we have to go through that arduous admission pipeline so that one day we can sit in an engineering class. 

It’s a suck-fest! Engineering schools? Yes! It’s gonna take everything away from you. Your entire vision of reality is gonna change within a matter of few weeks. The world you knew is gone. It’s gonna instill a new identity. 

The worst part is that in your head you’re like, we’re best of the best, we’re the top 2.5%! You know everything about everything and pretty soon you realize that you know almost nothing about nothing. That wasn’t a good evening for me, personally. 

You moved out of your parent’s and now you’re on your own. You burnout every afternoon. You go back to your 8x6 sq. ft. room on the Wednesday afternoon with the exhaustion of the entire week. That’s four sessional classes and fifteen to eighteen theory lectures, assignments and oh! hey, you gotta study for the class tests next Sunday and Tuesday and that’s a lot of work. That’s your life now. The funny thing is, it gets even harder each week and after every semester. 

I call mom everyday and it’s the same story, different context. She knows it’s hard. And she knows I’m capable of endurance. We already proved it’s who we are in the admission war. 

Nobody, and I mean, nobody can withstand a challenge of this caliber if he/she doesn’t have that level of endurance built into the identity in the admission war. The whole war season feels like a walk in the park now, but it’s what prepares us for the life that’s ahead. It’s the nature’s way of saying, “If you can prepare yourself, we have a pass for you. If you can’t, well, then there’s no point wasting resources on you.” 

Admission war is horrendous to go through. You go through 12-16 hour workdays and countless sleepless nights. You forget who you are, where you’ve been for the past three days, don’t remember if you had your dinner last night or not, you’re fatigued, completely exhausted and there’s a reason you have to go through it. I didn’t realize it back then but now I do. 

James Stockdale one of the most highly decorated officers in the history of the U.S. Navy. His plane was shot down over Vietnam in 1965, and he was held as a prisoner of war for seven and a half years. Seven and a half years! During his captivity he spent more than four years in solitary confinement and was repeatedly tortured—his shoulders torn from their sockets, his back broken, his legs crushed. He walked with a limp and endured much pain for the rest of his life.

Earlier in life while a student at Stanford, he learned the importance of seeing discomfort as providing a chance to act virtuously, instead of thinking of freedom and happiness as getting and doing whatever we want. As Epictetus says, “Do not ask things to happen as you wish, but wish them to happen as they do happen, and your life will go smoothly.” 

These are the words of James Stockdale, “After ejection… I whispered to myself: I’m leaving the world of technology and entering the world of Epictetus …” 

There’s no way we’re going through a challenge of that level, but for a kid who grew up in a world where parents don’t let their 16 yo to lift a five liter water bottle because it’s *too heavy*, university a real deal. And I get it, it’s a bit ironic! We’re actually in the realm of technology and engineering but…but, it’s where we are, the world of Epictetus. 

Every challenge we take on in life prepares us for the next one. We don’t rise to the level of your goals or wishes, we fall to the level of your comfort zone. You pushed your comfort zone, I pushed it. And I’m pushing it everyday. Trust me, everyday. Every single day. And this pain is… weakness leaving the body. That’s it. 

All these tests and assignments, they don’t bother me anymore. I learned a long time ago to remain calm in the chaos. “Hey, you got three theory lectures and two sessional classes tomorrow.” Well, it’s just Monday. 

It’s been an awesome ignition here in RUET. I found a community of thriving people, highly driven individuals, and teams, man, it’s a candy land! The war was worth it. This warrior lifestyle is totally worth it. The timing couldn’t be better. It’s the post pandemic world and it welcomed us by beginning the University chapter of our life. Loved it and that’s a story for another day. 

So coming back to the question, “Why’s nobody talking about the admission war?” Sir, do you need a better answer than the one you read above? If you still want it, then, “Well, that’s because it was the *Introduction* chapter. And those guys that are walking around you… are on chapter four, six, seven or ten.”
